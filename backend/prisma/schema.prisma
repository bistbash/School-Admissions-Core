  // Self-relation for commanders if needed, but requirements say "Commanders are contained in Permanent"

  // Let's add a boolean or just filter by type.
  // However, to explicitly link a commander to a department as "The Commander", we might need a field.
  // But "Mefaked/Mefakdim" (plural) implies a department can have multiple commanders.
  // So we can just query soldiers where type=PERMANENT and department=X.
  // OR, if there's a specific "Commander" role/assignment, we might need a separate relation or model.
  // The prompt says: "Department has commander/commanders (commanders are contained in permanent)".
  // This implies a subset of Permanent soldiers are commanders of the department.
  // I will add `isCommander` boolean for simplicity, or we can assume all Permanent in a Dept are commanders? 
  // Probably not. Let's add `isCommander` boolean.
